# HAVI Overview

HAVI is a web browser for HPPR content.

## Core capabilities

HAVI can:

- Open repos with `hppr://group/app/path{via:endpoint}`.
- Open `hppr://group/app/path` using route config from the home repo.
- Store local route and trust state in the home repo.

## URL entry and routing

Supported input forms:

- `hppr://group/app/path{via:endpoint}`
- `hppr://group/app/path`

`via` selects an explicit upstream endpoint when present.
Without `via`, HAVI resolves route config from the home repo.

For `hppr://group/app/path`, HAVI resolves route config from the home repo.
If no route exists, HAVI uses the home repo endpoint.

## JavaScript globals

HAVI exposes:

- `window.home`: local home repo client
- `window.route`: primary route repo client

See `060-JS-API.md` for full API details.
